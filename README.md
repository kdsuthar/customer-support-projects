Project Summary:
Executed a structured QA project to verify the functionality of various tabs under the Gmail Settings menu. The objective was to ensure each settings tab—General, Labels, Inbox, Accounts and Import, Filters and Blocked Addresses, and Forwarding and POP/IMAP—functioned correctly across different test cycles in Chrome browser within a controlled test environment.

Key Responsibilities:

Created and executed detailed test cases aligned with specific requirement IDs (e.g., BR_001 to BR_006).

Designed functional test scenarios and prepared test data using live Gmail URLs.

Identified and reported defects with unique defect IDs (e.g., DEF_001) and included screenshots and comments for failed cases.

Validated results across two test cycles, documented discrepancies, and retested fixes.

Summarized testing outcomes in a structured Test Result Summary and communicated observations to stakeholders.

Outcome:

Successfully validated 6 key Gmail settings tabs.

Identified and documented defects with clear remediation steps.

Demonstrated strong QA documentation, testing methodology, and issue tracking capabilities.
